  The levels of API standardization:
  
  - `OPEN_API` - Requirements at this level aim to increase reusability, discoverability and quality, without
    restricting APIs to specific technical and/or semantical standards.
  - `TECHNICALLY_STANDARDIZED_API` - Requirements at this level aim to increase the technical harmonization of APIs.
  - `FULLY_STANDARDIZED_API` - Requirements at this level aim to increase software interoperability by setting
    requirements for standardizing all parts of APIs.
