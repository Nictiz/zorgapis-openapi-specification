  Due to the different perspectives on what an API is, this specification differentiates between:
  
  - `API_SPECIFICATION` - An API specification is a formal specification of the API.
  - `API_SERVER_IMPLEMENTATION` - An API server implementation is the server-side software code that implements the
    API specification.
  - `API_SERVER_DEPLOYMENT` - An API server deployment is an instance of the server-side software; the actual service
    deployed by an organization to provide value for its clients.
  - `API_CLIENT_IMPLEMENTATION` - An API client implementation is the client-side software code that implements the
    API specification.
  - `API_CLIENT_DEPLOYMENT` - An API client deployment is an instance of the client-side software.
  - `API_AGREEMENT` - An API agreement is a legal agreement typically between a software provider and a client that
    outlines the terms of use for an API.
